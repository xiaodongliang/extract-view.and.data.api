## Motivation

Our View and Data API Beta adds powerful 2D and 3D viewing functionality to your web apps.
Our REST and JavaScript API makes it easier to create applications that can view, zoom and interact with 2D and
3D models from over 60+ model formats with just a web browser, no plugin required!

But what if you wanted to view them offline? Many people ask how to proceed, while the documentation
does not explicitly says how to proceed, however the API is public and documented.
This sample will go through all the required steps.


## Description

The workflow-node.js-server-view.and.data.api sample exercises and demonstrates the Autodesk View and Data API authorization,
translation, viewing processes mentioned in the Quick Start guide. It also demonstrates how to extract the 'bubbles' files
from the Autodesk server for storing and viewing them locally.

It closely follows the steps described in the documentation:

* http://developer.api.autodesk.com/documentation/v1/vs_quick_start.html

In order to make use of this sample, you need to register your consumer key:

* https://developer.autodesk.com > My Apps

This provides the credentials to supply to the http requests on the Autodesk server.


## Dependencies

This sample is dependent of Node.js and few Node.js extensions which would update/install automatically via 'npm':

## Setup/Usage Instructions

The sample was created using Node.js and javascript.

Live version at: http://extract.autodesk.io/

Developer version live at: http://extract-dev.autodesk.io/


### Setup
There is 3 ways to configure the sample with your application keys, please choose one of the option at step 4. Developers,
make sure to read [the developer notes](test/readme.md) before anything.<br />

1. Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (that will install npm as well)
2. Download this repo anywhere you want (the server will need to write files, so make sure you install in
   a location where you have write permission, at least the 'tmp', 'data' and '/www/extracted' folders)
3. Execute 'npm install', this command will download and install the required node modules automatically for you.
   These modules are only required for the translation/extraction processes.<br />
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your credential keys to run the sample: <br />
   a. Option 1: enter your keys in a permanent file which will never be saved in your GitHub repo. This is
      because you do not want to expose your keys to anyone, and this is the reason why this file is never
      saved in the repo. You can decide to save this file in a private GitHub repo by editing the .gitignore file.

      * From the sample root folder, rename or copy the ./server/credentials_.js file into ./server/credentials.js<br />
         * Windows<br />
           ```
            copy server/credentials_.js server/credentials.js
            ```
         * OSX/Linux<br />
            ```
            cp server/credentials_.js server/credentials.js
            ```

      * Edit credentials.js and replace keys placeholder (client_id and client_secret) with your keys. I.e.:<br />
      &lt;replace with your consumer key&gt; <br />
      &lt;replace with your consumer secret&gt; <br />

   b. Option 2: configure the server from the browser on first usage. For this:
      * Start the Node.js server (like at step 5)
      * After step 5, open your favorite browser and go to [http://localhost/setup.html](http://localhost/setup.html)
      This page will create the credentials.js file for you (like in Option 1).

   c. Option 3: use system environment variables. This is actually the option you need to use for the tests suite
      which runs on Travis-CI.
      * Define a CONSUMERKEY and CONSUMERSECRET system variables from the console or script which will launch the
         server.<br />
          * Windows<br />
            ```
            set CONSUMERKEY=xxx
            set CONSUMERSECRET=xxx
            ```
          * OSX/Linux<br />
            ```
            export CONSUMERKEY xxx
            export CONSUMERSECRET xxx
            ```
            or <br />
            ```
            sudo [PORT=<port>] CONSUMERKEY=xxx CONSUMERSECRET=xxx node start.js
            ```
            <br />
            Replace keys placeholder xxx with your own keys.

5. You are done for the setup, launch the node server using the command '[sudo] node start.js'.
   sudo is required only on OSX and Linux.<br />
   * Windows<br />
   ```
   [set PORT=<port>]
   node start.js
   ```
   * OSX/Linux<br />
   ```
   sudo [PORT=<port>] node start.js
   ```
   <br />
   <b>Note:</b> the port argument can be omitted and default to port 80. If port 80 is already in use by another
   application (like Skype, or IIS, or Apache, ...), you can use any other free port such as 8000, 3000, etc...
   But in the next section you would need to specify the port to use, i.e. http://localhost[:port]/

### Use of the sample

Translating files / Extracting 'bubbles'

1. Start your favorite browser supporting HTML5 and WEBGL and browse to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/).<br />
   <b>Note:</b> In case you use a different port above do not forget to include it in the URL. I.e.
   [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
2. Drag'n Drop your files into the 'Drop area' or browse for individual files.
   Tips: start with the main file in your file has dependencies, that will build the connections automatically.
3. If a connection is not correct, delete the connection by click on the connection line, and build a new connection
   starting from the parent 'yellow' square to the child dependency.
4. Once all files are uploaded on your local server and connections/dependencies are correct, give a bucket name,
   and submit the project to the Autodesk server for translating your file to a lightweight WEBGL format, and wait
   for the translation to complete.
5. After the translation completed successfully, move your mouse over the project thumbnail at the bottom of the page
   and press the 'Explore' button.
6. On the new page, you may see either a download button or an extraction button:
   * press the ![Download](www/img/extract.png) button to start the extraction process. When completed the button will
     change to a ![Download](www/img/download.png) button.
   * press the ![Download](www/img/download.png) button to download your 'bubbles' files.
7. You are done with translation and extraction.

## Package an offline viewing solutions

### Package with Python

On Windows only: simply copy the Python directory on your CD, and launch the server via a script when your application wants to show a LMV result. Make sure to set the PATH to point to your CD Python location to avoid errors.
On OSX, Linux: Python is already installed, so you can use the default Python on these OS.

Usage:
```
cd <my sample directory>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]
```

### Package with Node/http-server

on all platform you may install the http-server utility. http-server is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server. It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.

To  install http-server, go on your node.js console and enter the following command:
```
npm install http-server -g
```

Usage:
```
cd <my sample directory>
http-server [path] [options]
```

[path] defaults to ./public if the folder exists, and ./ otherwise.
